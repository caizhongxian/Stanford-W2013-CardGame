Matchismo Card Game 
===================

This is my version of the Matchismo Card Game of the Standford University CS193P course. The project is driven by requirements defined in course assignments. One of the key feature of my version is that it's driven by tests from the beginning rather than simply writing code.

Here is also other major features of this implementation.

## Features
- fully test-driven model logic (each time something is being implemented the test written first)
- granular commits - step by step addition of each little feature
- easy navigation through significant updates with useful tags (e.g. lecture2-hw, lecture3-slides)
- the match logic is universal for n-number of cards (2,3-card game is just an example) and still simple using simple formula (yes - math is good)
